<h3>JAFFA stands for Just Another Framework For AngularJS.</h3>

<p>I am creating this AngularJS framework to automate the following, </p>

1.  Static Web Project scaffolding - autocreate project structure to support modules,libs.
2.  RequireJS, RequireCSS support to dynamically load module java-script and css files as well as AngularJS Modules
3.  Enabling grunt tasks to create a build by combining and minifying static files, grunt task for jslint.
4.  Support for writing and running unit tests.

For now I have just finished the scaffolding part. 

Follow the steps to download and use the template
1. Install npm, grunt, grunt-cli and grunt-init.
2. Download/clone the template locally.
3. Run the command `grunt-init path to downloaded template`
4. Run `npm install` to install all the node_moduels. 
5. Run `grunt run-server` to run local dev server. After the server is started the default app automatically opens in browser.
